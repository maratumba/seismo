# What Is This?

This is a refactoring of [seisplotjs](https://github.com/crotwell/seisplotjs) codebase by Philip Crotwell, by splitting it into server and client side workspaces. 

The aim is to make it possible to run it in a non-browser environment and make contribution easier as pointed out by [baagaard-usgs](https://github.com/crotwell/seisplotjs/issues/1).
